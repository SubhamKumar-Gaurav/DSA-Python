## Heap 
#    Introduction  
#    Heap Implementation  
#    Binary Heap Insert
#    Binary Heap (Extract min and Heapify) 
#    Decrease Key and Delete operations 
#    Build Heap 
#    Heap sort 
#    Heapq in Python 




## Introduction  
#    Used in Heap Sort 
#    Used to implement Priority Queue 
#    Two types  (Min Heap and Max Heap) 

#   Binary Heap is a complete Binary tree (Stored as an array)   


## Heap implementation 
print("Heap implementation")  
## Main operations 
#    Constructor (simple)
#    Insert 
#    Extract min 
#    Decrease key
#    Delete 
#    Constructor (enhanced with build heap) 

## Utility Functions
